wmpower 0.3.0 (22 October 2003):
- Added machine id for Satellite Pro 6000
- Added support for hardware manifatured by Compal
  and used by vendors such as Acer, HP, Toshiba...
  You probably need to patch to your kernel to
  enable support for this. See file README.compal
  for all details. Credits and a big thank you go to
  Francisco Rodrigo Escobedo Robles <frer@pepix.net>
  who contributed this code.
- Added spec file for RPM creation, thanks (again) to
  Francisco Rodrigo Escobedo Robles.
- Yet another /proc file to read temperature from,
  thanks to Masahide Matsumoto <masahide@masahide.dip.jp>

wmpower 0.2.0 (30 September 2003):
- Project moved to autoconf/automake tools
- General code reorganization
- Hopefully lessened high CPU usage problems
	Note for DELL users: your problem sits in
	ACPI, not wmpower, so I can't help you :-(
	Try setting a higher polling interval
- Added option to set wmpower polling interval
- You can now choose which battery to monitor
- Added machine id for Toshiba Libretto L2
- Fixed bug that on some machines showed battery charge > 100%
- Added initial support for Dell laptops, thanks to
  code contributed by Massimo Battistel <mbat@libero.it>
	and revised by myself:
	- battery
	- fans (shows number of active fans)
	- temperature
- added another proc file to read temperature from
  (  patch contributed by Christian Schlamkow
     <christian.schlamkow@bau.uni-rostock.de>  )
- if battery charge is critical, not beep if AC power is on
  (  patch contributed by Christian Schlamkow
     <christian.schlamkow@bau.uni-rostock.de>  )
- Other things I'm forgetting to mention ;-)

wmpower 0.1.3 (04 June 2003):
- Various code clean-ups
- Made diagnostic messages a bit less 'scary'
- Fixed a segfault when using a malformed -B option
- New feature (for Toshiba): now wmpower tries to use acpi
	to set lcd brightness; if this fails it tries using
	hardware calls. This should work for newer Toshibas,
	where the hardware method fails
- New feature (for Toshiba): you can now adjust lcd
	brightness using your mouse wheel, step by step.
	Notice: right now, this works only for ACPI calls

wmpower 0.1.2 (21 March 2003):
- Makefile tweaks to make it aware of Gentoo Linux CFLAGS

wmpower 0.1.1 (19 March 2003):
- add support for CPU detection for compile optimizations
- different install for root/normal user

wmpower 0.1.0 (11 March 2003):
- First public release
