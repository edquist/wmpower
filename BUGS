BUGS list by Cezary M. Kruk <c.kruk@bigfoot.com> 2011-07-17:

* Some nearly completely charged batteries provide an invalid information to
  the ACPI causing the problems with the estimation of the time remaining to
  the end of the battery charging.  In such a situation wmpower displays the
  charging times rapidly changing in a wide range.

* With some completely charged batteries when you unplug the power and after
  a while plug it a new the ACPI has the problems with determining the time
  left to the end of the battery charging.  In such a situation wmpower
  instead of the time left to the end of the charging displays 00:00 as if
  battery was fully charged.

* Some invalid batteries provide false information to the ACPI.  In such a
  case wmpower can display: green or yellow battery, high percentage, long
  rainbow bar, and 00:00 minutes and seconds remaining to the end of the
  battery charging while in fact the battery doesn't work.  To avoid the
  problems when you see 00:00 charging time look at the battery led on your
  machine before you'll decide to unplug the power.

* If wmpower displays the times inconsistent with the pattern -XX:XX when
  charging the battery or with the pattern +XX:XX when discharging the
  battery -- such as: 9:03, - 8:07, or --6:15 -- it means the battery is
  going to die.  There's difficult to examine the program in such a situation
  because the battery dies before one manages to perform the tests.
