TODO list by Michele Noberasco <noberasco@zirak.it> 2005-06-22:

- Split the program in two parts:

  - powerd daemon, which will do all the low level power management stuff;

  - wmpower proper, which will be an interface to powerd, this way writing
    other user interfaces (KDE, Gnome etc.) will become much easier as the
    dirty stuff will be all in one place.

- Add theme support.

- Allow for multiple warning/commands for different configurable battery
  levels.


TODO list by Cezary M. Kruk <c.kruk@bigfoot.com> 2012-04-16:

- Test the program on the other machines.  (If you had to modify wmpower in
  order to force the program to work with your machine send me the modified
  version for approval and inclusion of your changes.)
